# Penetration Testing Approach for Distributed Firewalls

## 1. Introduction
Distributed firewalls enforce security policies at multiple network points, but their complexity can introduce 
hidden vulnerabilities. This document details the penetration testing methodology applied to assess and enhance 
their security.

## 2. Reconnaissance Phase
- Collected information about the network topology and firewall nodes.
- Used network mapping tools (e.g., Nmap) to identify active hosts and services.
- Gathered configuration files where accessible.

## 3. Scanning and Enumeration
- Performed port scans to detect open ports.
- Enumerated firewall rules to identify possible misconfigurations.
- Checked software versions for known vulnerabilities.

## 4. Vulnerability Assessment
- Compared findings against known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
- Assessed rule conflicts or overlaps that could allow unauthorized access.

## 5. Exploitation
- Attempted to bypass firewall rules through crafted packets.
- Tested privilege escalation by exploiting software weaknesses.
- Simulated Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks where applicable.

## 6. Post-Exploitation Analysis
- Measured the potential impact of successful exploits.
- Assessed data leakage, unauthorized access, and service disruption risks.

## 7. Reporting and Recommendations
- Documented all vulnerabilities with evidence.
- Provided prioritized mitigation steps:
  - Updating firewall rules for stricter access control
  - Applying software patches and updates
  - Enhancing monitoring and alerting mechanisms

## 8. Conclusion
The penetration tests highlighted critical areas for improvement, demonstrating the need for continuous 
monitoring and tailored testing of distributed firewall setups.
